Pokemon Theme
TV version

[Verse 1]
I wanna be the very best (WE THE BEST MUSIC!)
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause (cause~)
I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Teach Pokémon to understand
The power that's inside (OH YEAHHHHHH!)

[Chorus]
Pokémon 
(Gotta catch 'em all), it's you and me (YOU AND ME BABY!)
I know it's my destiny
Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokémon (Gotta catch 'em all), a heart so true (oooohh~)
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me, and I'll teach you
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all! (ALL!)
Gotta catch 'em all!
Po-ké-mon! (PIKA PIKA)

[Chorus (Tagalog)]
Pokémon
(Makukuha silang lahat), ikaw at ako
Ito ang aking tadhana
Oh, ikaw ang aking matalik na kaibigan
Sa mundong dapat nating ipaglaban
Pokémon (Makukuha silang lahat), pusong tapat
Ang tapang natin ang magtatagumpay
Ituturo mo sa akin, ituturo ko sa’yo
Pokémon
Makukuha silang lahat!
Makukuha silang lahat!
Po-ké-mon!

"Pokémon Theme" was written by John Siegler and John Loeffler, and performed by Jason Paige.
This song served as the original theme for the first season of the English adaptation of the Pokémon anime.
Since then, its iconic line, "Gotta catch 'em all!" became the franchise's official English slogan.
